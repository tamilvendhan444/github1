### Design Patterns Used
- **DAO Pattern**: Clean separation of data access logic
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation
- **Singleton Pattern**: Database connection management
- **MVC Pattern**: Separation of concerns in GUI

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with 6 well-designed tables:

1. **users** - User accounts and authentication
2. **buses** - Bus information and capacity
3. **routes** - Route details and fare multipliers
4. **schedules** - Bus schedules and timings
5. **bookings** - Reservation records
6. **seats** - Individual seat status tracking

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### User Management
- Secure registration with validation
- Role-based access (Customer/Admin)
- Profile management
- Session management

### Bus Management
- Complete CRUD operations
- Real-time seat availability
- Bus type categorization (Luxury/Standard/Economy)
- Status tracking (Active/Inactive/Maintenance)

### Booking System
- Interactive seat selection
- Real-time availability checking
- Fare calculation with multipliers
- Booking confirmation and cancellation
- Travel date management

### Admin Panel
- Comprehensive bus management
- Booking oversight and monitoring
- User account management
- System administration tools

## 🎨 User Interfaces

### Console Interface
- Clean, intuitive menu system
- Real-time data display
- Input validation and error handling
- Admin and customer role separation

### GUI Interface
- Modern Swing-based design
- Tabbed interface for different functions
- Interactive tables and forms
- Real-time updates and validation

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for service classes
